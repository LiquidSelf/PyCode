===================
Python in Minecraft
===================

I wanted to code Python stuff in Minecraft, so I smooshed jython
in and added some extra stuff.

What you can do
===============

Once you've created a Python Block or Hand you can write some Python
code in a Writeable Book (or the superior Python Code Book), right click
it on a the Python Hand or Block and have that code be run.

If you want to delay the running of your code you can put all the code
in a run() function. That function will then be run only when you right
click the Python Wand on the hand or block.

Also, Python Blocks may have other events that they handle:

Redstone Power

   If you define a powerOn() or powerOff() function these will be called
   when the block receives, or loses redstone power (eg from redstone
   wiring, or just a button placed on the block.)

Time Passsing

   If you define a tick() function this will be called about 20 times
   per second.



Recipes

Wand
~~~~

Wands are used to create Python Code Books and interact
with Python Blocks and Python Hands.

+------------+-------------+------------+
|            |             | Lapis      |
+------------+-------------+------------+
|            | Redstone    | Yellow Dye |
+------------+-------------+------------+
| Stick      |             |            |
+------------+-------------+------------+

Python Block
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python blocks sit in the world and can do stuff.

+-------------+-------------+------------+
| Cobblestone | Lapis       | Cobblestone|
+-------------+-------------+------------+
| Lapis       | Redstone    | Yellow Dye |
+-------------+-------------+------------+
| Cobblestone | Yellow Dye  | Cobblestone|
+-------------+-------------+------------+

Hand
~~~~

Python hands can move around in the world and can do stuff.

+-------------+-------------+------------+
|             | Lapis       |            |
+-------------+-------------+------------+
| Wool        | Redstone    | Yellow Dye |

Python Code Book
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Craft a Python Wand with a Writeable Book. It's a superior
editable book that will also check your Python code for
syntax errors.


Hand OR Block
-------------

::

    block.chat(“message”)

    block.world - the world object
    block.pos - the BlockPos
    block.player - the activating player
    block.blocks - Blocks.class
    block.items - Items.class
    block.entities - EnumEntities.class

    block.water(pos.up())
    block.lava(pos.left())
    block.clear(pos.left())


Event Handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  def run():
    # invoked when activated with the wand


Block
-----

:: 

    block.powered (boolean)

    block.firework()

    block.spawn(entities.CREEPER)   (ZOMBIE, SKELETON)

Event Handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  def powerOn():
    # invoked when a redstone signal powers block
  def powerOff():
    # invoked when redstone signal stops powering block
  def tick():
    # invoked every server tick (20 times a second?)



Hand
----

::

    hand.forward()
    hand.forward(10)
    hand.backward(5)
    hand.reverse()
    hand.left()
    hand.right()
    hand.face(‘north’) (south, east, west)
    hand.move(x, y, z)

    hand.water()   # only if clear
    hand.lava()    # only if clear
    hand.clear()

    hand.put(blocks.COBBLESTONE)
    hand.line(5, blocks.STONE)
    hand.circle(5, blocks.STONE, False) // filled
    hand.ellipse(5, 10, blocks.STONE, True)
    hand.door(blocks.OAK_DOOR)
    hand.ladder(8, blocks.LADDER)



Wand
----

Invokes run() in the hand or block.


Building This Mod
=================

Three steps are needed to build this mod:

1. Get Forge (for minecraft 1.10) going, using the instructions here for
   IntelliJ setup:

   http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/index.php/topic,21354.0.html

2. Add jython by including the following in the ``build.gradle``
   dependencies section:

       // https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.python/jython-standalone
       compile group: 'org.python', name: 'jython-standalone', version: '2.7.0'

3. Check this git repository out to replace the "src" folder of the Forge
   folder.

You should now be able to compile and run minecraft with this mod.


Distribution

This section TBD.


TODO
====

*editing*
- selection-based copy/cut/paste
- scrolling rather than paging
- filename to tooltip / save as

*wand*
- bring up a REPL when activated against air

*blocks*
- pull from inventory, push out
- output: generates redstone signal
- wiring: for linking the above together
